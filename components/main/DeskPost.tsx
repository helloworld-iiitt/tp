                        Indian Institute of Information Technology Tiruchirappalli (IIITT) is an
                        initiative under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model with a
                        primary focus on addressing the challenges faced by the Indian IT
                        industry and the growth of the domestic IT sector. IIITT attracts students
                        from all over the country and abroad. The purpose of an institution of
                        higher learning is to impart/inculcate the best of the academic
                        experience in a chosen discipline with specialized knowledge in the
                        core curriculum for the initial 2 years and industry expertise within the
                        last 2 years. IIITT evolves into a milieu that dedicates itself to shaping
                        the students into better human beings and employable professionals
                        with local skills for global needs. The academic and internship
                        opportunities encourage student initiatives by engaging them in
                        cutting-edge technology research to meet the current needs and future
                        challenges of India and the world at large. The institute imparts
                        Information Technology education with practical experience to
                        students who will be future leaders with the ability to work in
                        challenging situations. A major objective in establishing IIITT is to set up
                        a model of education which can produce best-in-class human
                        resources in IT and harness the multidimensional facets of IT. While the
                        number of students produced would be small, the impact they create
                        would be great.
